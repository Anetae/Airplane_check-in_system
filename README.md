# 2. Data Collection, Integration, and Analysis
### 2.1 Data Collection Implementation:
For a simulated Airplane Check-In System, static data can be collected to represent passenger check-in scenarios. Below are simplified code snippets for data collection, assuming a simplified passenger structure:
``` js
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_PASSENGERS 100

struct Passenger {
    char name[50];
    int seatNumber;
};

struct Passenger passengers[MAX_PASSENGERS];
int totalPassengers = 0;

// Function to simulate passenger check-in and data collection
void simulateCheckIn() {
    printf("Enter passenger name: ");
    scanf("%s", passengers[totalPassengers].name);

    printf("Enter seat number: ");
    scanf("%d", &passengers[totalPassengers].seatNumber);

    totalPassengers++;
}

// Function to display collected data
void displayData() {
    printf("\nCollected Data:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < totalPassengers; i++) {
        printf("Passenger %d: %s - Seat: %d\n", i + 1, passengers[i].name, passengers[i].seatNumber);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    // Simulate check-in for three passengers
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        simulateCheckIn();
    }

    // Display collected data
    displayData();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- simulateCheckIn(): Simulates the process of a passenger checking in by accepting their name and seat number as input and storing it in the array of structures.
- main(): Iterates three times to simulate check-in for three passengers. Afterward, it displays the collected data, including passenger names and seat numbers.

### 2.2 Data Integration:
For data integration, the collected passenger data can be stored in an array of structures in C. This structure efficiently organizes the information for easy access and manipulation:
``` js
struct Passenger {
    char name[50];
    int seatNumber;
};

struct Passenger passengers[MAX_PASSENGERS];
int totalPassengers = 0;
```

#### Explanation:
- struct Passenger: Defines a structure named `Passenger` to encapsulate information about each passenger. It includes a character array for the passenger's name and an integer for the seat number.
- passengers[MAX_PASSENGERS]: An array of `Passenger` structures, capable of storing information for up to `MAX_PASSENGERS` passengers.
- totalPassengers: Keeps track of the current number of passengers in the system.

#### Justification:
- Efficiency: Arrays provide constant-time access to elements, making it efficient to access and manipulate passenger data.
- Simplicity: The simplicity of the array of structures aligns with the straightforward nature of the check-in system.
- Readability: Using structures improves code readability by encapsulating related data fields within a single logical unit.

### 2.3 Data Analysis:
For basic data analysis, consider a simple algorithm to calculate the average seat number of checked-in passengers:
``` js
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to calculate the average seat number
float calculateAverageSeat() {
    if (totalPassengers == 0) {
        return 0; // Avoid division by zero
    }

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < totalPassengers; i++) {
        sum += passengers[i].seatNumber;
    }

    return (float)sum / totalPassengers;
}

int main() {
    // Simulate check-in for three passengers
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Enter passenger name: ");
        scanf("%s", passengers[totalPassengers].name);

        printf("Enter seat number: ");
        scanf("%d", &passengers[totalPassengers].seatNumber);

        totalPassengers++;
    }

    // Calculate and display the average seat number
    printf("Average Seat Number: %.2f\n", calculateAverageSeat());

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- calculateAverageSeat(): Calculates the average seat number by summing up all seat numbers and dividing by the total number of passengers.
- main(): Simulates check-in for three passengers and then calculates and displays the average seat number.

#### Code Structure and Organization:
The code for the Airplane Check-In System is organized into several key components:
``` js
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_PASSENGERS 100

// Data structure to represent a passenger
struct Passenger {
    char name[50];
    int seatNumber;
};

// Array to store passenger data
struct Passenger passengers[MAX_PASSENGERS];
int totalPassengers = 0;

// Function prototypes
void simulateCheckIn();
void displayData();
```
- Header Inclusions: The necessary header files are included at the beginning of the code.
- Macro Definition: The maximum number of passengers (`MAX_PASSENGERS`) is defined as a macro for easy modification.
- Data Structure Definition: The `struct Passenger` structure is defined to store information about each passenger.
- Global Variables: An array (`passengers`) and a counter (`totalPassengers`) are declared to store and track passenger data.
- Function Prototypes: Prototypes for functions (`simulateCheckIn` and `displayData`) are declared for use later in the code.

``` js
int main() {
    // Main execution logic
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```
- `main` Function: This is the main entry point of the program, where the overall execution logic is coordinated.

``` js
void simulateCheckIn() {
    // Simulate check-in logic
    // ...
}

void displayData() {
    // Display collected data logic
    // ...
}
```
- `simulateCheckIn` Function: Simulates the check-in process by collecting passenger data.

- `displayData` Function: Displays the collected data in a structured format.

#### Detailed Explanation of Key Sections and Algorithms:

- `simulateCheckIn` Function:
   - This function prompts the user for passenger information (name and seat number) and stores it in the passengers array.
   - Input validation and handling are implemented to ensure data integrity.

``` js
void simulateCheckIn() {
    if (totalPassengers < MAX_PASSENGERS) {
        printf("Enter passenger name: ");
        scanf("%s", passengers[totalPassengers].name);

        printf("Enter seat number: ");
        scanf("%d", &passengers[totalPassengers].seatNumber);

        totalPassengers++;
    } else {
        printf("The airplane is full. Cannot check in more passengers.\n");
    }
}
```
- `displayData` Function:
   - This function iterates through the collected passenger data and displays it in a structured format.
 
``` js
void displayData() {
    printf("\nCollected Data:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < totalPassengers; i++) {
        printf("Passenger %d: %s - Seat: %d\n", i + 1, passengers[i].name, passengers[i].seatNumber);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

- Main Execution Logic:
   - The `main` function orchestrates the overall flow of the program, allowing users to simulate check-in and displaying the collected data.

This structure facilitates modularity, making it easy to understand, maintain, and expand the Airplane Check-In System. The code focuses on user interactions, data management, and providing clear feedback during the check-in process.
